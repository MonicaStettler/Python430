# BABY NAMES

# =============================================================================
# Find on the D2L two datafiles, “namesBoys” and “namesGirls”, containing the 1000 
# most popular baby names in the United States in 2010.  Define a function that reads 
# the two datafiles into memory storing them in two lists.  For each letter, a through z, 
# count the number of times a names ends in a particular letter.  
# Finally, print the counts to the console in well formatted and sorted columns, 
# so that the data line up nicely
# =============================================================================
"""
# =============================================================================
# Finally, include as a comment at the end of your code a paragraph discussing 
# any interesting differences you found in the comparison of the endings of boys and girls names.

#COMMENTS ON INTERESTING DIFFERENCES IN BOY VS GIRL NAMES:
#Not surprisingly, 'a' is by far the most popular ending for girl names(almost 
#twice as popular as the next most popular letter), followed by 'e', 'n', 'y' in order. 
#Also not surprising is that 'n' is the most popular boys name, but it is surprising
#that it is 3x more popular than the next most popular letter). The letter 'e' is 2nd most popular boy name,
#followed by 'o'. I find 'o' surprising. Also interesting was that there were boy names
#that ended in every letter but 'q', while there were 10 letters for which there
#were no girl names with that ending letter: 'b','f','g','j','k','o','p', 'q','u','v'.
